# Encryptor User Manual

## Use
Encryptor takes a message as input and outputs an encrypted message based on the chosen alphabet and shift number by the user. It can also decrypt a message that has been encrypted with a Normal English alphabet. The decryption is based on the letter 'e' being the most common used letter in the English alphabet.

## Steps
* Type a message you want to encrypt into the space right of "Message:". The message must contain at least one letter.

* Enter a number to the right of "Shift Number:". This number will shift the alphabet used for encryption purposes. The shift number must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 26.

* Select which alphabet to use for encryption from the dropdown menu to the right of "Alphabet:". There are 3 options: Normal, Reverse, and PASDFG.

* Click the "Encrypt" button, and your encrypted message will appear underneath "Encrypted Message:" at the bottom of the screen.

* Click the "Decryptor" button to navigate to the decryption page.

* Type an encrypted message you want to decrypt. Note: the decryption only works for messages encrypted with a Normal English alphabet.

* Click the "Decrypt" button, and your decrypted message will appear underneath the "Decrypted Message:" at the bottom of the screen.

* Click the "Encryptor" button to navigate to the encryption page.
